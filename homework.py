#Outputs for loops
# 1.a. output = 1 2 3 4 5
# 1.b. output = 1 2 3
# 1.c. output = 1 3 5
# 1.d. output = 6 5 4 3 2    

#2.Loop thats print my name 100 times.
# Each output should be on a new line
# for eachPass in range(100):
#     print("Leah", sep=" ")
    
#3.Loop that prints the first 128 ASCII values followed by the corresponding characters
#Number 3 ?

#4.Loop that prints each character in a string
#Number 4 ?

#5.Using for loop and range() to print even numbers from 2 to 20.
# for count in range(2,21,2):
#     print(count, end =" ")

#6.for loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100
# theSum = 0
# for count in range(1, 101):
#     theSum += count
# print(theSum)

#7. Given a list of numbers, use a for loop to find and print the maximum number.
# max_num = 1
# for count in range(1,5):
#     max_num = max(max_num, count)
# print(max_num)
    
#8. This is a list of test grades: 98, 76, 87, 71, 83, 90, 57, 79, 82, and 94.
# Use the for loop to calculate and print of the class average.
# grades = [98,76,87, 71, 83, 90, 57, 79, 82, 94]
# theSum = 0
# ave = 0
# for count in grades:
#     theSum += count
#     length = len(grades)
#     ave = theSum/length 
# print(ave)

#9. Use the range() and a for loop to calculate the total of the integers from 0 through 1,000,000
# theSum = 0
# for count in range(0, 1000001):
#     theSum += count
# print(theSum)

#10.  Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table up to 12.
# number = int(input("Enter number:"))
# for count in range(1, 13):
#     print(f"{number} x {count} = {number * count}")
